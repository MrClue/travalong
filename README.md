# TRAVALONG

A Flutter application developed for our Software Engineering Bachelor project.

## The Project

Travalong is a cross platform app currently in development for iOS and Android. It aims to support travellers and facilitate connections with others interested in travel. Some of the key features of the app include:

- Setting up a profile and searching for other travellers based on search criteria such as location, interests, and travel dates
- Sorting search results based on interests in common, making it easy for users to find compatible travel companions
- A chat function for users to easily communicate with their connections

Travalong is a useful tool for travellers seeking travel companions to enhance their travel experiences.
